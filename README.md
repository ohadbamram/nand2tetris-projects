# Nand2Tetris-Projects
This repository contains my implementations of the projects from the Nand2Tetris course, where I built a basic computer system from the ground up. The course, based on the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, covers the construction of a modern computer system starting from basic logic gates and culminating in a high-level programming language.

Projects Overview
The projects are divided into two main parts:

Part 1: Hardware
Basic Logic Gates: Built basic logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) using only NAND gates.

Combinational Chips: Designed more complex chips such as Adders, ALUs, and multiplexers.

Sequential Chips: Implemented memory units like Flip-Flops, Registers, and RAM.

CPU and Computer Architecture: Designed a fully functional CPU and a complete computer system capable of executing machine language programs.

Part 2: Software
Assembler: Developed an assembler to translate assembly language programs into machine code.

Virtual Machine: Built a virtual machine that translates high-level intermediate code (VM code) into assembly language.

Compiler: Created a compiler for a high-level object-oriented language (Jack) that translates Jack programs into VM code.

Technologies Used
Hardware Description Language (HDL): Used to design and simulate the hardware components.

Java: Used to implement the assembler, virtual machine, and compiler.

Assembly Language: Wrote low-level programs to test the CPU and computer system.

How to Run the Projects
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nand2tetris-projects.git
Navigate to the specific project folder (e.g., projects/01 for the first project).

Use the online IDE tools (e.g., HDL simulator, assembler, or VM emulator) to test and run the projects.

Challenges and Learnings
Understanding Low-Level Computing: Gained a deep understanding of how computers work at the hardware and software levels.

Problem-Solving: Overcame challenges in designing efficient logic circuits and translating high-level concepts into low-level code.

Debugging: Learned to debug complex systems by simulating and testing each component step-by-step.
