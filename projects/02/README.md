# Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic

## Overview
This project focuses on building arithmetic chips such as **Half-Adder**, **Full-Adder**, and a **16-bit Adder**. These chips are essential for performing binary arithmetic.

## Files
- `HalfAdder.hdl`: Half-Adder implementation.
- `FullAdder.hdl`: Full-Adder implementation.
- `Add16.hdl`: 16-bit Adder implementation.
- `Inc16.hdl`: 16-bit Incrementer implementation.

## How to Run
1. Open the **Hardware Simulator**.
2. Load the `.hdl` files and test them using the provided test scripts.
