# Project 3: Sequential Logic

## Overview
This project involves building **sequential logic chips** such as Flip-Flops, Registers, and RAM. These chips are used to store and manage state in a computer system.

## Files
- `DFF.hdl`: Data Flip-Flop implementation.
- `Bit.hdl`: 1-bit Register implementation.
- `Register.hdl`: 16-bit Register implementation.
- `RAM8.hdl`: 8-register RAM implementation.

## How to Run
1. Open the **Hardware Simulator**.
2. Load the `.hdl` files and test them using the provided test scripts.
